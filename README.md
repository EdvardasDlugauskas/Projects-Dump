# Projects-Dump
A dump of older, yet interesting projects in C++ and Python

Listed in order of creation 2014-2016

# Edos explorer
An ASCII roguelike in C++. The idea was that I programmed a game and others created text levels for it since they couldn't program very well. My first big project. Even has sounds and colors!

# Army Sim
An ASCII army simulator attempt with C++. Uses multiple inheritance, A\* pathfinding Will crash if you enter too many soldiers :(

# Snake Python
A not-so-original remake of a classic in Python (duh). Uses pretty sprites :)

# Merger and Drawer
Merger is a big project, that aimed to do the impossible - combine two arbitrary shapes into one. The requirement is very subjective, but I was surprised to find out nobody has done it before (at least I couldn't find anything similar). There's lots of math involved, but it does the job pretty well. In the end, there were a few other things that I had to do to finish the project, but I lost motivation.

Drawer is a tool that I used to create lists with coordinates to use them in Merger project when combining.
